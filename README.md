# Books2Scrape
This was my first offical web scrape repo.  I used BeautifulSoup to scrape books.toscrape.com.  I organized the data from said scrape into a Pandas dataframe, and wrote that to a csv and exported it to Google Sheets.  Nothing fancy.

Libraries used in this project were: bs4, pandas, requests, pydrive.drive, pydrive.auth, google.oauth2.service_account, gspread, and gspread_dataframe.
